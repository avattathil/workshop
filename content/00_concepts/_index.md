# Config hierarchy 

Taskcat uses two config files **Global config**  and **Project config**

## Project Config
Ths config file provides project specific configuration.

The project config file is located in the root of your project folder `<PROJECT_ROOT>/.taskcat.yml` 

## Global config
This config file  provides global settings that become defaults for **all projects**.

The global config file is located in the users homedir  `~/.taskcat.yml`
