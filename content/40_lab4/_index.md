# What you will do in this lab:
In this lab we see how taskcat can be useful in testing an application.  We will deploy a pre-configured application via cloudformation abd validate the functionality by trying out it out.

We will learn how to use taskcat to do a local deployment of our app and instruct taskcat not to delete the stack at completion using it as a test deployment tool
