However, Global parameters take precedence over project-level parameters. See below for more details.\nParameter Overrides Parameter Overrides were added to taskcat to solve a common problem: we didn\u0026rsquo;t want to add sensitive data (usernames, passwords, tokens) to a git repository. The idea was to store sensitive data outside of a git repository, but still execute a test using this data. To that end, any parameter defined in the global config will take precedence over the same parameter in a project-level config. We use this feature to ensure we\u0026rsquo;re using the appropraite S3 Buckets, keypairs, etc.\n(Psuedo) Parameters To increase the flexibility of taskcat, we\u0026rsquo;ve built in support for psuedo-parameters that are transposed at runtime for actual values.\n   Psuedo-Parameter Example Value passed to the CloudFormation stack Details     $[taskcat_autobucket] taskcat-tag-sample-taskcat-project-5fba6597 Note: The S3 Bucket is created   $[taskcat_genaz_1] \u0026ldquo;us-east-1a\u0026rdquo; Fetches a single Availability Zone within the region being launched in   $[taskcat_genaz_2] \u0026ldquo;us-east-1a,us-east-1b\u0026rdquo; Fetches two AvailabilityZones within the region being launched in   $[taskcat_genaz_3] \u0026ldquo;us-east-1a,us-east-1b,us-east-1c\u0026rdquo; Fetches three AvailabilityZones within the region being launched in   $[taskcat_genpass_8A] tI8zN3iX8 An alphanumberic 8-charater random password.

AWS Codepipeline has a source action for AWS Code commit repository, and a build action uses AWS Code Build to run tests. The Code Build runs TaskCat to perform the tests, similar to how you run TaskCat locally on your laptop.\nAfter you have set-up a CI/CD pipeline for your project, next time you push any changes to your git repository, it will trigger the pipeline.

This is because, when the code pipeline is created for the first time, it automatically gets triggered and start the pipeline execution.\nThe Source action of the pipeline takes the code from the AWS Code Commit repository and puts it into an S3 bucket. This S3 bucket acts as a source for the next stage of the pipeline, which is Build stage.\nIn Build stage, pipeline is using AWS CodeBuild to run TaskCat for your project. It performs all the tests, as defined in the project configuration file. On success, it merges the source branch into the target/release branch.\nValidate code promotion After the pipeline execution is completed successfully, you should have all the changes committed to the source (develop) branch, available in target/release (master) branch.

It has been extracted from the Requests project.\nInstallation certifi is available on PyPI. Simply install it with pip:\n$ pip install certifi   Usage To reference the installed certificate authority (CA) bundle, you can use the built-in function:\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import certifi \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; certifi.where() '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem'  Or from the command line:\n$ python -m certifi /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem  Enjoy!\n1024-bit Root Certificates Browsers and certificate authorities have concluded that 1024-bit keys are unacceptably weak for certificates, particularly root certificates. For this reason, Mozilla has removed any weak (i.e. 1024-bit key) certificate from its bundle, replacing it with an equivalent strong (i.e. 2048-bit or greater key) certificate from the same CA. Because Mozilla removed these certificates from its bundle, certifi removed them as well.\nIn previous versions, certifi provided the certifi.old_where() function to intentionally re-add the 1024-bit roots back into your bundle. This was not recommended in production and therefore was removed at the end of 2018.\n  "},{"uri":"/lab_assets/start/lab2/cfn-project/lambda_functions/source/genrandom/chardet-3.0.4.dist-info/description.html","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Chardet: The Universal Character Encoding Detector Build status https://img.shields.io/coveralls/chardet/chardet/stable.svg Latest version on PyPI License Detects ASCII, UTF-8, UTF-16 (2 variants), UTF-32 (4 variants) Big5, GB2312, EUC-TW, HZ-GB-2312, ISO-2022-CN (Traditional and Simplified Chinese) EUC-JP, SHIFT_JIS, CP932, ISO-2022-JP (Japanese) EUC-KR, ISO-2022-KR (Korean) KOI8-R, MacCyrillic, IBM855, IBM866, ISO-8859-5, windows-1251 (Cyrillic) ISO-8859-5, windows-1251 (Bulgarian) ISO-8859-1, windows-1252 (Western European languages) ISO-8859-7, windows-1253 (Greek) ISO-8859-8, windows-1255 (Visual and Logical Hebrew) TIS-620 (Thai)    Note\nOur ISO-8859-2 and windows-1250 (Hungarian) probers have been temporarily disabled until we can retrain the models.\n Requires Python 2.6, 2.7, or 3.3+.\n Installation Install from PyPI:\npip install chardet   Documentation For users, docs are now available at https://chardet.readthedocs.io/.\n Command-line Tool chardet comes with a command-line script which reports on the encodings of one or more files:\n% chardetect somefile someotherfile somefile: windows-1252 with confidence 0.5 someotherfile: ascii with confidence 1.0   About This is a continuation of Mark Pilgrim's excellent chardet. Previously, two versions needed to be maintained: one that supported python 2.x and one that supported python 3.x. We've recently merged with Ian Cordasco's charade fork, so now we have one coherent version that works for Python 2.6+.\nmaintainer:Dan Blanchard     "},{"uri":"/lab_assets/start/lab2/cfn-project/lambda_functions/source/genrandom/idna-2.8.dist-info/license.html","title":"","tags":[],"description":"","content":"License Copyright (c) 2013-2018, Kim Davies.
